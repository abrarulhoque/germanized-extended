## we have this plugin called germanized aed totals @germanized-aed-totals.php 

## it registers a block to woocommerce germanized invoice template editor that shows the currency in aed. 

## but now the issue is the design and functionality of our custom block isn't same as germanized 'item total row' block. 

## i have added 'woocommerce-germanized' and 'woocommerce-germanized-pro'. these are not the part of our plugin and you can't make modifications to them. but you have study them. so, in germanized or the pro plugin, it has a block 'item-total-row' that shows the order total amount in the invoice. now, i would like to show the order total exactly the same as item total row but in aed, we already have the functionality to show and convert, but the design and functionality are not similar. 

## what i want you to do is track down all the files related to the item total row block in germanized plugin including php, css and js scripts. after that i want you to apply the same design/feature in our custom 'aed total' block. 

## our custom aed total block registers the block with germanized and integrates very well, so make sure you don't break that. but we need the exact 100% same feature as germanized total block while it's just showing the aed amount instead of euro.
